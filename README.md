# Python Shorts

This repository is where I share all the little tidbits of Python knowledge that I find useful for Machine Learning and that might not be generally known. Or at least that I found neat and surprising at some point.

1. [Debugging inside Jupyter Notebooks](https://radekosmulski.github.io/python_shorts/debugging_inside_jupyter_notebooks.html)
2. [Passing data around](https://radekosmulski.github.io/python_shorts/passing_data_around.html)
3. [Caching expensive calculations](https://radekosmulski.github.io/python_shorts/caching_expensive_calculations.html)
4. [Providing access from mobile phones to notebooks shared on GitHub](https://radekosmulski.github.io/python_shorts/provide_access_to_notebooks_from_mobile_phones.html)

I mostly learned these from watching the wonderful [fast.ai Deep Learning lectures](http://course.fast.ai/) or from studying the accompanying [library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai).

This is one of many projects that I have undertaken thanks to receiving inspiration and support from a great community of Machine Learning practitioners. You can find our forums [here](http://forums.fast.ai/). Feel free to stop by if you would like to chat about anything Machine Learning / Deep Learning related!
