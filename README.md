# Python Shorts

This repository is where I keep all the little tidbits of Python knowledge that I find useful for Machine Learning and that might not be generally known. Or at least that I found neat and surprising at some point.

I mostly learned about these studying the [fastai library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai). But there is at least one - maybe there will be more - that are not used in the library.

I also have good news for you. If you happen to be interested in Machine Learning there is a great and welcoming community that I am very lucky to be a part of. You can find the fastai forums [here](http://forums.fast.ai/). Feel free to stop by if you would like to chat about anything Machine Learning / Deep Learning related!
